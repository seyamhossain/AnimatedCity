ðŸš¦ Animated City Traffic Simulation

Overview
Animated City Traffic Simulation is a dynamic 2D city scene built using C++ and OpenGL (GLUT). It showcases animated vehicles, pedestrians, environmental elements, and a realistic day/night cycle â€” all combined to bring a lively urban setting to life.

This project demonstrates animation principles, object interaction logic, time-based events, and simple AI behavior in an OpenGL environment.

âœ¨ Features
Realistic Day/Night Cycle

Smooth sky color transitions from morning to night.

Sun and Moon movement across the sky.

Buildings light up at night; vehicle headlights and streetlights activate automatically.

Animated Traffic

Multiple vehicle types (cars, buses, trucks) with different speeds and sizes.

Two-way traffic flow with basic predictive braking and lane behavior.

Traffic lights controlling vehicle movement with realistic stop/go rules.

Pedestrian Movement

Pedestrians walk on sidewalks during the day.

Crosswalk logic where pedestrians wait for a green signal to cross.

Pedestrian behavior changes at night (walking stops, pedestrians become semi-transparent).

Dynamic Sky Elements

Clouds move across the sky (daytime only).

Birds flying animations during daytime.

Cityscape Details

Buildings of various shapes and heights.

Trees, roads with lane markings, sidewalks, a control tower structure.

Performance Optimized

Uses basic OpenGL primitives (quads, triangles, circles) for smooth, efficient rendering.

ðŸ›  Requirements
C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)

OpenGL and GLUT (or FreeGLUT)

ðŸ“¦ Installation
Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install freeglut3-dev g++
Fedora:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo dnf install freeglut-devel gcc-c++
macOS (with Homebrew):
